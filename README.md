## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an accurate and robust speech emotion recognition system capable of identifying emotions from audio samples. Specifically, we aimed to:

1. Implement a hybrid deep learning model combining CNN-LSTM architecture with HuBERT pre-trained speech representations
2. Extract comprehensive acoustic features to capture emotional cues in speech signals
3. Implement ensemble learning techniques to improve model robustness and accuracy
4. Evaluate the performance across different emotional categories
5. Create a system capable of analyzing real-world audio samples for emotion recognition

## Problem Statement

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents numerous challenges in the fields of speech processing and affective computing. Traditional approaches have limitations in capturing the complex nature of emotional expressions in speech, leading to unsatisfactory performance in real-world applications. Key challenges include:

1. **Feature Extraction Complexity**: Determining which acoustic features best capture emotional content remains challenging, as emotions manifest in diverse ways across different speakers.

2. **Inter-speaker Variability**: Different speakers express the same emotion with varying acoustic patterns, influenced by factors such as gender, age, cultural background, and individual speaking styles.

3. **Limited Labeled Data**: High-quality emotion-labeled speech datasets are relatively scarce compared to other speech processing tasks.

4. **Ambiguity of Emotional States**: Emotions often co-occur or have subtle differences that make clear classification difficult.

5. **Model Generalization**: Models trained on one dataset often struggle to maintain performance when tested on different datasets or in real-world conditions.

This project addresses these challenges by proposing a hybrid approach that combines traditional acoustic feature extraction with state-of-the-art self-supervised learning representations, enhanced by ensemble techniques to improve robustness and generalization.

## Methodology

Our approach employs a novel hybrid architecture that leverages the complementary strengths of multiple techniques:

### 1. Dataset

We utilized the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS), which contains recordings from 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male) vocalizing lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. The dataset includes 7 emotional categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.

### 2. Feature Extraction

Our system implements a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline:

- **MFCCs**: 30 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients with delta and delta-delta features (90 features total)
- **Energy Features**: To capture intensity patterns associated with emotional expression
- **Spectral Contrast**: For representing the level difference between peaks and valleys in the spectrum
- **Zero-Crossing Rate**: To distinguish voiced/unvoiced speech segments
- **Chroma Features**: To capture tonal content relevant to emotional expression

### 3. Model Architecture

Our hybrid model consists of two parallel pathways:

#### CNN-LSTM Pathway
- Three convolutional blocks with increasing filter sizes (32, 64, 128)
- Batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dropout for regularization
- Bidirectional LSTM with 2 layers and 128 hidden units
- Mean pooling across time steps for fixed-length representation

#### HuBERT Pathway
- Pre-trained HuBERT model (Hidden-Unit BERT for speech representation)
- Fine-tuning of higher encoder layers
- Custom output processor to extract relevant representations

#### Fusion Mechanism
- Concatenation of feature vectors from both pathways
- Multi-layer fusion network with attention mechanism
- Final classification layer with 7 output neurons (one per emotion)

### 4. Ensemble Approach

To improve robustness and accuracy, we implemented an ensemble of 3 models with:
- Different random initializations
- Soft voting (probability averaging) for final predictions
- Hard voting (majority decision) as an alternative strategy

### 5. Training Approach

Our training methodology included:
- Stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
- Data augmentation (pitch shifting, time stretching, adding noise)
- Mixed precision training for efficiency
- Component-specific learning rates
- OneCycle learning rate scheduler
- Early stopping and model checkpointing

## Results

Our hybrid CNN-LSTM + HuBERT ensemble model achieved excellent performance on the test set:

### Key Performance Indicators:

1. **Overall Accuracy**: 94% across all emotion categories
2. **Balanced Performance**: High precision and recall across all emotion classes
3. **Strong F1 Scores**: All emotion categories achieved F1 scores above 0.90
4. **Perfect Precision for Surprise**: 100% precision for the "surprise" emotion
5. **Perfect Recall for Neutral**: 100% recall for the "neutral" emotion

### Analysis of Results:

1. **Ensemble Advantage**: The ensemble approach resulted in more robust predictions compared to individual models, with a 5-8% improvement in accuracy.

2. **Emotion-Specific Performance**:
   - Surprise was the most accurately predicted emotion (F1 = 0.97)
   - Sad emotions were relatively more challenging (F1 = 0.91)
   - Neutral emotions had perfect recall but slightly lower precision

3. **Error Analysis**:
   - Most confusion occurred between fear and sad emotions
   - Disgust was occasionally misclassified as anger
   - Happy was sometimes confused with surprise

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - Energy features were crucial for distinguishing high-arousal emotions (anger, happiness)
   - Spectral contrast and MFCC features contributed significantly to identifying disgust and fear
   - HuBERT representations enhanced performance for neutral and sad expressions

## Conclusion

Our hybrid CNN-LSTM + HuBERT approach demonstrates exceptional performance in speech emotion recognition, achieving 94% accuracy across seven emotional categories. The combination of handcrafted acoustic features with self-supervised speech representations, enhanced by ensemble techniques, proves highly effective in capturing the complex patterns associated with emotional expression in speech.

Key strengths of our approach include:
- Complementary feature representation from multiple pathways
